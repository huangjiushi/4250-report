# IS4250-report

Dear Prof

Please put all the files in the same directory for running the r markdown report. For the r markdown report, the tables will render on github page. However, tables cannot be rendered when you run the r markdown on r studio. Formulas are in latex syntax and they cannot be rendered on github page. However, formulas can be rendered when you run the r markdown file in r studio.

We have also uploaded the pdf file where the tables and formulars are able to show.

If there are any problems running the r markdown report, please feel free to contact us at either a0105542@u.nus.edu or ye.shujian@u.nus.edu 

Thank you very much for your time in evaluating our project!
